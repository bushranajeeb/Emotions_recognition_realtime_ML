# Emotions_recognition_realtime_ML

An open-source dataset called FER 2013 was used for the purpose of training consist of 48x48 pixel images of all classes. This manuscript focuses on 7 essential 
facial expressions classes which are Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise and neutral.

The categorised facial images with emotion dataset are sent  to CNN and then CNN is trained by these images, after that the  anticipated CNN model decides which facial expression is performed.

To test the model directly without performing training through deep neural network, please use the saved model fer7_model.h5 with its weights, using the real time testing code provided in the repo.

Output video shows the detected emotions in real time
